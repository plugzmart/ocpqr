# OCPQR: Open Charge Point QR Code

## Standardized QR Data Format for EMSP/EV Charger Apps

### **Overview**
This repository contains the whitepaper proposing a standardized QR code data format for Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, titled **"OCPQR: Open Charge Point QR Code"**. The aim of this initiative is to enhance interoperability, improve user experience, and streamline EV charging across multiple networks and mobile apps.

### **Abstract**
Fragmentation in QR code formats among different CPOs and EMSPs creates significant challenges for EV users. Current systems lack standardization, forcing users to manually select chargers, which becomes cumbersome, especially at locations with multiple chargers. 

This whitepaper introduces a universal QR code format for EV chargers to ensure:
- **Interoperability**: Seamless access across various platforms.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplified identification of specific chargers and connectors.
- **Broad Adoption**: Support for multiple protocols like OCPI and UEI with a standardized approach.
